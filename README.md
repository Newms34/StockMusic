## Music... from stocks!

This project uses the Quandl API to grab stock data over a time period for TWO different stocks.
For now, only the AAPL (Apple, inc.) and MSFT (Microsoft) stocks have been tested to be working. I'm finishing formulae to standardize the results

The Program then uses ONE stock for the frequencies of notes played and ANOTHER stock for the tempo of notes played.
