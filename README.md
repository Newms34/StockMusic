## Music... from stocks!
***
This project uses the Quandl API to grab stock data over a time period for TWO different stocks.
For now, only the AAPL (Apple, inc.) and MSFT (Microsoft) stocks have been tested to be working. I'm finishing formulae to standardize the results

The Program then uses ONE stock for the frequencies of notes played and ANOTHER stock for the tempo of notes played.

##Instructions:
***
1. Pick one stock symbol. Enter it in the first box and click "Get Melody Stock Data"
2. Pick another stock symbol. Enter it in the second box and click "Get Tempo Stock Data".
3. Plug in earphones and stick in those holes on the side of your head. You know, ears. 
4. Turn volume down LOW!
5. Press Play.
6. See bugs and laugh.
